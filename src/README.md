# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

Hello and welcome to the Optimistic Ethereum Docs!
We aim to be the best source of technical information about [Optimistic Ethereum](https://optimistic.etherscan.io/).
You'll find links to all of our documentation in the sidebar to the left üëà.

## Can't find what you're looking for?

Did we miss something important?
[Tell us about it on GitHub](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/community-hub/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=issues.md).
We rely on user reports to figure out what documentation we should be writing.
If you feel that something is missing, please do let us know and we'll do our best to get it added to this site ‚ù§Ô∏è.

## Not sure where to start?

### Want to play with some apps on Optimistic Ethereum?

If you're looking to play with decentralized apps on Optimistic Ethereum, check out the [Getting Started](./docs/getting-started/basics.md) docs.
They'll help you make your first transaction and find stuff to do once you're on Optimistic Ethereum.

### Want to build your own app on Optimistic Ethereum?

If you want to build and deploy your own decentralized app on Optimistic Ethereum, read through the [Building Apps on OE](./docs/building-apps/basic-deploy.md) section.
You might also find value in our section on [Useful Tools for Developers](./docs/useful-tools/networks.md).

### Want to learn more about how Optimistic Ethereum works?

Check out our docs that explain what Optimistic Ethereum looks like [Under the Hood](./docs/under-the-hood/theory.md).
Rollups are really cool, you won't regret it!
Once you do, you can also learn about ways to use your new rollup expertise to [contribute to the Optimistic Ethereum protocol specification](./docs/getting-involved/contributing-to-protocol.md).

### Want to learn about Retroactive Public Goods Funding?

[Optimism](https://optimism.io) is experimenting with a new model for funding public goods called Retroactive Public Goods Funding (aka RetroPGF).
If you're interested in learning more, check out our [intro to RetroPGF](./docs/retropgf/what-is-retropgf.md).
