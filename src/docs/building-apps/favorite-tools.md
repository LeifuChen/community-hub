- TL;DR
  - You should be able to use your favorite tools out of the box
- Hardhat
  - Just add OE to your hardhat config when deploying
- Truffle
  - Just add OE to your truffle config when deploying
- Brownie
  - Just add OE to your brownie config when deploying
- Other stuff
  - Again, should just work.
  - If something doesn't work, create an issue and report it because OE is meant to "just work".
